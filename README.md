# Bad-Passwords-and-the-NIST-Guidelines
We looked at what passwords fail to conform to the National Institute of Standards and Technology password guidelines.

### Project Description
Almost every web service we join requires you to come up with a password. But what makes a good password? In June 2017 the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) published publication 800-63B titled Digital Identity Guidelines: Authentication and Lifecycle Management. This publication doesn't tell you what is a good password, but it does have specific rules for what is a bad password.

In this project, we take a list of user passwords and, using publication 800-63B, write code that automatically detects and flags the bad passwords.
